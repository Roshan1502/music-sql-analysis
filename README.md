# music-sql-analysis
This project is a detailed SQL analysis of a sample Music Store database using MySQL Workbench. The analysis focuses on extracting business insights related to customer behavior, sales performance, and genre/artist popularity. Key findings from the project include:

1.Identified the top revenue-generating customer and the countries with the highest total sales.

2.Analyzed track popularity by quantity sold and calculated revenue generated per track.

3.Determined the most popular music genres and their contribution to overall revenue.

4.Found the artist and album with the highest total revenue.

5.Calculated average track duration per album and per genre.

6.Extracted customer data who purchased specific genres like Rock or Metal, and tracks by specific artists like Aerosmith.

7.Generated year-wise and country-wise invoice trends.

The project demonstrates the use of advanced SQL techniques such as multiple types of joins (INNER, LEFT), aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT), subqueries, filtering with WHERE and LIKE, and grouping to perform data exploration and reporting.
